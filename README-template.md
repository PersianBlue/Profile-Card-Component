## My process

I started with a mobile-first design as usual, but got stuck on trying to get the bubbles background to only take up a part of the card, with the profile picture overlayed on top of it. I didn't find a fitting solution on google, but then when I eventually left the image in place, I realized that it sized itself automatically according to the design given.

The next greatest challenge was getting the background circles to stay in the opposite corners, and get bigger with larger screen sizes. I looked up how to do multiple background images and found a few articles on that, but ultimately it was the solutions from others that helped me see how to position them appropriately.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to have multiple background images, and how to position them responsively using ems, rems, vw and vh units.

### Continued development

I want to get better at using CSS grid, as well as manipulating images to get a particular design concept, while still being responsive.

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools CSS background-position](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) as well as https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp helped me in placing the background images where I needed them instead of having to use a div
